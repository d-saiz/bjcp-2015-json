Oak is inappropriate\n          in this style.","mouthfeel":"Smooth, medium-light to medium-bodied mouthfeel without hop-derived\n          astringency, although moderate to medium-high carbonation can combine\n          to render an overall dry sensation despite a supportive malt presence.\n          A low, smooth alcohol warming can and should be sensed in stronger\n          &#40;but not all&#41; versions.","comments":"The attributes of IPA that were important to its arrival in good\n          condition in India were that it was very well-attenuated, and heavily\n          hopped. Simply because this is how IPA was shipped, doesn’t mean that\n          other beers such as Porter weren’t also sent to India, that IPA was\n          invented to be sent to India, that IPA was more heavily hopped than\n          other keeping beers, or that the alcohol level was unusual for the\n          time. Many modern examples labeled IPA are quite weak in strength.\n          According to CAMRA, “so-called IPAs with strengths of around 3.5% are\n          not true to style.” English beer historian Martyn Cornell has\n          commented that beers like this are “not really distinguishable from an\n          ordinary bitter.” So we choose to agree with these sources for our\n          guidelines rather than what some modern British breweries are calling\n          an IPA; just be aware of these two main types of IPAs in the British\n          market today.","history":"Accounts of its origins vary, but most agree that what became later\n          known as IPA was pale ale prepared for shipment to India in the late\n          1700s and early 1800s. George Hodgson of the Bow Brewery became\n          well-known as an exporter of IPA during the early 1800s, and is the\n          first name frequently mentioned with its popularity. As with all\n          English beers with a long history, the popularity and formulation of\n          the product changed over time. Burton breweries with their\n          high-sulfate water were able to successfully brew IPA and began their\n          domination of this market by the 1830s, around the time the name India\n          Pale Ale was first used. Strength and popularity declined over time,\n          and the style virtually disappeared in the second half of the 20th\n          century. The name was often used to describe pale ales and bitters,\n          not anything special &#40;a trend that continues in some modern British\n          examples&#41;. The style underwent a craft beer rediscovery in the 1980s,\n          and is what is described in these guidelines. Modern examples are\n          inspired by classic versions, but shouldn’t be assumed to have an\n          unbroken lineage with the exact same profile. White Shield is probably\n          the example with the longest lineage, tracing to the strong Burton\n          IPAs of old and first brewed in 1829.","ingredients":"Pale ale malt. English hops are traditional, particularly as finishing\n          hops. Attenuative British ale yeast. Refined sugar may be used in some\n          versions. Some versions may show a sulfate character from Burton-type\n          water, but this is not essential to the style.","comparison":"Generally will have more finish hops and less fruitiness and/or\n          caramel than British pale ales and bitters.

Regional differences exist in Ireland,\n          similar to variability in English Bitters. Dublin-type stouts use\n          roasted barley, are more bitter, and are drier. Cork-type stouts are\n          sweeter, less bitter, and have flavors from chocolate and specialty\n          malts.

Guinness began brewing only porter in 1799, and a\n          “stouter kind of porter” around 1810. Irish stout diverged from London\n          single stout &#40;or simply porter&#41; in the late 1800s, with an emphasis on\n          darker malts. Guinness was among the first breweries to use black\n          patent malt for porters and stouts in the 1820s. Guinness began using\n          roasted barley after WWII, while London brewers continued to use brown\n          malt. Guinness started using flaked barley in the 1950s, also\n          increasing attenuation greatly. Guinness Draught was launched as a\n          brand in 1959. Draught cans and bottles were developed in the late\n          1980s and 1990s.","ingredients":"Guinness is made using roasted barley, flaked barley, and pale malt,\n          but other breweries don’t necessarily use roasted barley; they can use\n          chocolate or other dark and specialty malts.

Stone Arrogant Bastard was born out of a\n          batch of pale ale that was mistakenly made with excess ingredients,\n          thus creating what may have been the prototype for the imperial\n          amber/red ale. Great Lakes first brewed Nosferatu in the early 1990s\n          and called it a stock ale, although they now call it an imperial red\n          ale. So whether by direct historical inspiration or by accident, the\n          style developed independently in the craft beer era and has\n          subsequently become quite popular.","ingredients":"Well-modified pale malt as a base; some character malts would be\n          appropriate, medium to dark crystal malts are typical.

Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the\n          standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when\n          Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called\n          and said, “your barleywine is too bitter” - to which Sierra Nevada\n          replied, “thank you.”","ingredients":"Well-modified pale malt should form the backbone of the grist.

Differs from\n          a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more\n          forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. An American\n          Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than a Double IPA,\n          which affects the overall drinkability &#40;sipping vs. drinking&#41;.","examples":"Avery Hog Heaven Barleywine, Anchor Old Foghorn, Great Divide Old\n          Ruffian, Rogue Old Crustacean, Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, Victory Old\n          Horizontal","tags":"very-high-strength, amber-color, top-fermented, north-america,\n          craft-style, strong-ale-family, bitter, hoppy","stats":{"og":{"flexible":"false","low":"1.080","high":"1.120"},"fg":{"flexible":"false","low":"1.016","high":"1.030"},"ibu":{"flexible":"false","low":"50","high":"100"},"srm":{"flexible":"false","low":"10","high":"19"},"abv":{"flexible":"false","low":"8.0","high":"12.0"}}},{"id":"22D","name":"Wheatwine","impression":"A richly textured, high alcohol sipping beer with a significant\n          grainy, bready flavor and sleek body.

Its hallmark was\n          that it was inexpensive and quickly produced, typically 6 to 8 days\n          from mash to delivery. The beer was racked into barrels while actively\n          fermenting &#40;1.020 - 1.022&#41; and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in\n          the saloon cellar. There is some speculation that it was a variant of\n          the lighter common or cream ale produced throughout much of the East\n          prior to the Civil War and that the darker grains were added by the\n          mostly Germanic brewers to help acidify the typical carbonate water of\n          the Louisville area, or that they had a preference for darker colored\n          beers. Up until the late 19th century, Kentucky Common was not brewed\n          in the summer months unless cellars, usually used for malting, were\n          used for fermentation. With the advent of ice machines, the larger\n          breweries were able to brew year round. In the period from 1900 to\n          prohibition, about 75% of the beer sold in the Louisville area was\n          Kentucky Common. With prohibition, the style died completely as the\n          few larger breweries that survived were almost exclusively lager\n          producers.","ingredients":"Six-row barley malt was used with 35% corn grits to dilute the\n          excessive protein levels along with 1 to 2% each caramel and black\n          malt.

Imported\n          continental Saazer-type hops &#40;.1 pounds per barrel&#41; were added at\n          knock out for aroma. Water in the Louisville area was typically\n          moderate to high in carbonates. Mash water was often pre-boiled to\n          precipitate the carbonate and Gypsum was commonly added. Considering\n          the time from mash in to kegging for delivery was typically 6 to 8\n          days, clearly aggressive top-fermenting yeasts was used.","comparison":"Like a darker-colored cream ale emphasizing corn, but with some light\n          character malt flavor.
